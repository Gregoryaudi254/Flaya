Last Updated: 17th Nov 2024

Flaya is committed to respecting the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same. This Intellectual Property Policy explains our practices regarding intellectual property, including copyright, trademarks, and other proprietary rights.
1. Ownership of Content

All content, trademarks, logos, service marks, designs, and other intellectual property related to Flaya (collectively, "App Content") are owned by [App Name] or our licensors. This includes, but is not limited to:

    Text, images, logos, icons, videos, and sounds.
    Software, code, and design elements of our app.

You are granted no rights or licenses to use App Content unless expressly provided in these terms or with our prior written consent.
2. User-Generated Content

When you create, post, or share content on Flaya ("User Content"), you retain ownership of that content. However, by posting or sharing, you grant [App Name] a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, display, reproduce, distribute, and modify your User Content within the Service. This license is necessary for [App Name] to operate the Service effectively and is revoked if you delete your content or terminate your account, except where the content has been shared with others and they have not deleted it.
3. Prohibited Content and Intellectual Property Violations

You may not post or share any content that:

    Infringes on another’s copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other proprietary rights.
    Contains illegal or infringing material, including pirated software, counterfeit goods, or stolen intellectual property.

Users are solely responsible for ensuring that their User Content does not infringe on the rights of others. [App Name] reserves the right to remove content that violates this policy or the rights of others, including in response to valid takedown requests.
4. Copyright Infringement and Takedown Requests (DMCA Compliance)

If you believe your copyright-protected work has been posted on [App Name] without authorization, you may submit a takedown request. Please provide the following information:

    A description of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed.
    The location of the allegedly infringing material on our app.
    Your contact information (name, address, email, and phone number).
    A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
    A statement that the information you have provided is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

Please submit this information to Flaya at flayasupport@gmail.com.
5. Trademark Policy

[App Name] respects trademark rights. If you believe your registered trademark has been used in a way that causes confusion about its source, please contact us. Include information about your trademark registration, how it is used in the Service, and why you believe it constitutes infringement.
6. Counter-Notification (DMCA Compliance)

If you believe content you posted was wrongfully removed in response to a copyright claim, you may file a counter-notification. Include the following information:

    Identification of the content removed and its previous location.
    A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe the content was removed due to a mistake or misidentification.
    Your consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in your district (or where you reside if outside the U.S.).

Send this counter-notification to Flaya at flayasupport@gmail.com. We may restore the content if the original copyright claimant does not pursue legal action.
7. Repeat Infringers

Users who repeatedly violate this Intellectual Property Policy, particularly by posting infringing content, may have their accounts suspended or terminated.
8. Reporting Other Intellectual Property Violations

For other intellectual property issues, please contact us at flayasupport@gmail.com. We take reports seriously and will review complaints promptly.
9. Updates to This Policy

We may update this Intellectual Property Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted with an updated “Last Updated” date.
